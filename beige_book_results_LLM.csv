The strongest report came from the San Francisco district, which said its economy expanded soundly.  Most other districts also gave quite favorable reports, saying their economies improved, strengthened further, or grew at a moderate pace.  However, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas reported only slow or modest growth, and St. Louis said conditions were mixed.  Retailers and manufacturers reported that prices were generally steady despite increases for raw materials.Holiday retail sales were generally positive across the country, and auto sales either improved or held steady in most districts.  Manufacturing activity increased in nearly all districts, and New York, Philadelphia, and Kansas City noted some growth in factory employment.  Housing remained strong, particularly in the Boston and San Francisco districts.  Commercial real estate was still weak, although a few districts reported signs of firming.  Travel and tourism activity increased considerably, and gains were reported in most other service industries as well.  Bank loan demand was flat or slightly lower, with credit quality generally unchanged.  Energy and agricultural activity was steady in most districts, although the appearance of mad cow disease created considerable uncertainty in the cattle industry.Along with the increase in overall economic activity, many districts reported modest improvements in labor markets.  These improvements took the form of reduced layoffs or modestly increased hiring, although new hiring was still quite minimal in several districts and most types of workers remained easy to recruit.  Health care and other employee benefit costs continued to rise.  However, with labor markets still slack, wage pressures remained generally subdued.  Retail prices were generally flat, with some districts reporting less discounting of holiday retail prices than in previous years.  Manufacturers in most districts also held their selling prices steady, despite substantial increases in the prices of some raw materials such as steel and natural gas.Reports on holiday retail sales were generally upbeat across the country, particularly for sales during the last two weeks of 2003.  San Francisco gave the strongest report, saying robust sales led to considerable year-over-year gains.  Holiday sales were also quite solid in the Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City districts.  Most other districts reported more modest year-over-year sales growth, although some of these districts noted an improvement in sales at the end of December.  Cleveland, on the other hand, said retailers were generally disappointed by sluggish sales during the holidays.  All districts reporting on store inventories said stock levels were generally in good shape for 2004, and all districts reporting on expectations for future retail sales anticipate continued improvement in the months ahead.Reports on auto sales were also generally positive, with most districts reporting either steady or improving sales at the end of the year.  Cleveland, St. Louis, and Minneapolis characterized new vehicle sales as ""strong"" or ""solid"" in December, although St. Louis reported that sales of used cars were not as robust as sales of new cars.  Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco all noted some improvement in vehicle sales from previous months, while Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas said sales were mixed or flat.  Philadelphia noted that a seasonal slowing in auto sales resulted in a buildup of inventories, and dealers in the Cleveland district were worried about their ability to sell all of their 2003 models.  Otherwise, though, districts reporting expectations for auto sales were generally optimistic about 2004.Nearly all districts reported increases in manufacturing activity in December, and several districts noted that factory employment had begun to edge up as well.  Chicago reported broad-based improvement across manufacturing industries, and Dallas and San Francisco said factory activity increased in a variety of sectors.  Philadelphia, Richmond, and Kansas City noted strong orders in December, and Boston said several firms had been ""pleasantly surprised"" by recent increases in orders.  Factory employment was reported to have posted modest overall gains in the New York, Philadelphia, and Kansas City districts, and factory jobs also reportedly picked up in select industries or for select occupations in the Boston, Richmond, and San Francisco districts.Manufacturers across the country generally expect factory conditions to continue to improve in the months ahead, and several districts noted that capital spending in 2004 will be somewhat higher than in 2003.  Much of the increased spending will go towards replacement of outdated IT and other capital equipment, but both Chicago and Kansas City reported a few firms plan plant expansions as well.  Exceptions to the optimistic outlook included textile producers in the Boston and Richmond districts, who continue to suffer from excess capacity.Residential real estate activity remained robust, with home sales and new construction reported to be strong in most districts.  In the Boston district, home sales in Massachusetts continued to rise at double-digit rates, while housing activity in other parts of the district returned to more normal levels following boom conditions during the last two years.  In the San Francisco district, home sales increased and home price appreciation remained solid.  In most other districts, home sales and single-family homebuilding were reported to be holding steady at high levels.  The only districts reporting some slowdown in overall housing activity were Chicago and Dallas.  Contacts in the Chicago district said some easing was inevitable given the previous boom, but Dallas reported that high inventories of existing homes were becoming a concern.  Both Boston and Kansas City reported that the high-end market was weaker than the entry-level market, although tentative signs of a turnaround in high-end construction were noted in Kansas City.  The multifamily market remained weak in the few districts reporting on this sector, the only bright spot being a modest recovery in apartment rents in New York.Commercial real estate activity remained weak, although there were signs of improvement in a few districts.  In most districts, commercial real estate markets and nonresidential construction were described as soft with little improvement expected in the near term.  Commercial builders in the Cleveland district viewed 2003 as a weak year and did not expect conditions to improve for at least the next six months.  In the Chicago district, vacancy rates remained elevated in most segments of the market, and contacts saw no indication of a firming in demand at the end of the year.  On a more positive note, however, a few districts reported either a pickup in activity or improvement in expectations for the future.  For example, Atlanta reported that commercial construction activity was still generally weak but that leasing activity continued to improve.  In the Dallas district, the office market remained soft, but contacts were increasingly optimistic that the worst was behind them.  The strongest report came from the Richmond district, where contacts were highly encouraged by a pickup in leasing activity late in the year.Travel and tourism activity improved substantially.  Boston, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco all reported a surge in visitors to ski resorts due to very good snow conditions, while Atlanta noted increased optimism about winter tourism in Florida and New Orleans.  Boston also reported a positive outlook for international bookings due to the lower dollar and promotional airfares.  Demand for hotel rooms in New York remained strong, as brisk leisure travel activity more than compensated for a continued slump in business travel.  In other reports on business travel, Atlanta observed a modest increase in convention bookings, while Boston noted increased spending on corporate entertaining and higher bookings for corporate meetings in 2004.Activity in other service industries generally expanded as well.  Several districts reported increased demand for freight transport services.  For example, Cleveland observed busy trucking activity serving retailers, Dallas reported increased rail shipments of lumber due to strength in construction, and San Francisco noted that exports and holiday imports kept several seaports operating at capacity.  Looking at other sectors, Dallas reported robust growth in legal services, Philadelphia noted improved demand at marketing firms, and New York cited unusually brisk hiring for office jobs.  Boston reported little change in overall demand for insurance, with slightly higher sales of long-term care products but lower revenue from large-property insurance.  On a negative note, Richmond indicated lackluster activity at several business support and technical firms.Overall demand for bank loans either remained unchanged or declined somewhat in most districts.  Home mortgage lending continued to fall due mainly to lower refinancing activity.  Banks in the Chicago district reported that new mortgage originations were also slowing somewhat, although such lending remained fairly strong.  Demand for consumer loans fell somewhat in the New York and St. Louis districts and rose in the Philadelphia and Kansas City districts.  Business loan demand increased in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and St. Louis districts but held steady or weakened in other districts.  Banks in the Richmond district attributed the increased demand for business loans to the stronger economy and were optimistic about lending prospects for 2004.  In the Chicago and San Francisco districts, banks reported more inquiries about lending terms from small businesses, even though overall business lending remained flat.Credit quality and lending standards were little changed in most districts.  Credit quality was described as stable in the Philadelphia district, although some banks reported higher defaults on consumer loans.  Banks in the New York district reported fewer delinquencies in all loan categories except business loans.  In the Chicago district, business loan quality improved, but home mortgage loan quality eroded slightly.  The only changes in credit standards were in the New York district, where they were tightened slightly for non-mortgage loans, and in the Chicago district, where some large banks were said to be loosening standards on business loans in an effort to boost lending.Activity in natural resource industries generally held steady.  Ore mining in the Minneapolis district continued at a strong pace, as some mines produced near capacity while other, previously shut, mines reopened.  Energy activity in the Dallas district was little changed, but contacts noted continuing excess capacity in the oil services and machinery industry.  Oil and gas drilling in the Kansas City district remained unchanged at levels considerably higher than a year ago, while Minneapolis reported a decrease in both oil and natural gas exploration.  Looking ahead, natural gas producers in the Kansas City district plan increased capital spending in anticipation of continued strong production, but contacts in both the Kansas City and Dallas districts expect some decline in oil production in coming months.While most districts reported steady conditions in the farm economy, the appearance of mad cow disease created substantial uncertainty in the cattle industry.  Farm incomes were supported in the Chicago district by strong hog production and by rising corn and soybean prices, while incomes in the Kansas City district were maintained by high soybean prices and still-elevated cattle prices.  In the San Francisco district, farmers benefited from strong holiday sales of cut flowers and Christmas trees.  Crop conditions in the Atlanta and Dallas districts were reported as stable.  However, farmers in some parts of the Minneapolis and Kansas City districts continued to suffer from drought, and Richmond reported harvest and planting delays due to excessive precipitation.  The emergence of a case of mad cow disease in Washington state resulted in a great deal of uncertainty for cattle ranchers.  Contacts in several districts noted substantial declines in cattle prices due to foreign bans on U.S. beef exports.  The uncertainty was causing ranchers in the Kansas City and Dallas districts to take a wait-and-see approach toward herd adjustments.  San Francisco, on the other hand, reported that the appearance of mad cow disease was boosting sales of range-raised beef.Most districts reported modest improvements in labor markets in December.  San Francisco noted a pickup in hiring, Minneapolis reported more hiring announcements than layoff announcements, and Kansas City said layoffs dropped considerably.  Likewise, demand for temp workers increased in the Philadelphia and Richmond districts, and Chicago said the seasonal decrease in temp employment this year was less than in the previous two years.  On the other hand, hiring was said to be quite minimal in several districts.  Cleveland, for example, noted that most firms still do not plan to increase payrolls in the near future.  In addition, while hiring improved somewhat in the Atlanta district, firms generally remained reluctant to add full-time staff.  Both Kansas City and Dallas noted some pickup in demand for high-tech workers, although such workers were still easily recruited in the Kansas City district and some types of high-tech and telecom work in the Dallas district continued to be outsourced overseas.  Acute labor shortages were generally reported only for select health care fields, with some hospitals in the Atlanta district recruiting overseas to fill open nursing positions.Wage pressures generally remained subdued throughout the nation, but most districts continued to report greater upward pressure on health care and other employee benefit costs.  Chicago, Kansas City and San Francisco described wage increases as ""weak"" or ""modest"" and Boston stated that wages were mostly stable.  Exceptions were reported in the Dallas district, with wages subject to downward pressure in the airline industry but upward pressure in certain occupations such as skilled mechanics.  Meanwhile, districts consistently reported that employee benefit costs continued to increase.  San Francisco said that the improving job market was making it harder to shift increases in health care premiums to workers, resulting in slightly higher growth of total compensation.Most districts reported little change in final goods prices, but costs of some raw materials rose noticeably.  Retail prices were generally stable.  Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco all reported less discounting of holiday retail prices than in previous years, although a few other districts said holiday discounts were similar to last year.  In manufacturing, the most widely cited increase in raw materials costs was for steel.  Contacts in the Cleveland district said steel producers were raising prices to cover the increased cost of their own inputs, such as scrap and iron ore, and that steel prices were likely to continue rising through the first quarter.  Price increases were also reported in some districts for copper and aluminum.  In the Boston district, prices of lumber and plywood were reported to have fallen back somewhat from the highs reached in the third quarter, but contacts in other districts said these prices were still well above year-ago levels.  In most districts, manufacturing firms were reported to still be having difficulty passing input costs on to their customers.  In the Dallas district, petrochemical producers held their selling prices steady in the face of sharply rising natural gas prices, and trucking firms kept their rates unchanged despite higher fuel costs.  The only signs of a change in pricing power were in the New York and Kansas City districts, where some firming in selling prices was reported.', 'hiring market': 6, 'material prices': 5}",6.0,7.0,8.0,5.0

Consumer spending rose in most Districts. There were gains in sales of general merchandise in January and February in all Districts except St. Louis, which reported a slight decline. In contrast to the general improvement in merchandise sales, motor vehicle sales slowed in most Districts. Tourism activity increased compared to last winter. Service sector activity has been expanding. Manufacturing output continued to rise in all Districts except Cleveland, where it has been steady. Real estate market conditions showed little change: commercial markets generally remain soft and demand for housing continues to be strong. Agricultural conditions were mixed: demand for beef appears to be recovering from the effects of mad cow disease but exports of poultry products have been curtailed by the outbreak of avian influenza. Oil and gas production remain at high levels and iron ore processing has increased. Bank lending has been growing moderately. Employment has been growing slowly in most Federal Reserve Districts. Wages and salaries have increased slightly, but employers report substantial increases for employee health-care costs. Most Reserve Banks reported level or modestly increasing retail prices, but information received from manufacturers and other businesses indicates that commodity prices have moved up more noticeably.

Three Districts--Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco--characterize growth as ""solid,"" while a number of others describe the rate of economic activity as ""modest,"" ""moderate,"" or ""steady."" Richmond notes a quicker pace of growth, and Dallas indicates that activity continued to strengthen. By contrast, New York says the rate of growth may have slipped a bit since the last report. \n\nMost Districts report that orders or revenues in the manufacturing sector continue to come in ahead of year-earlier levels, although New York notes some deceleration in manufacturing activity, and Atlanta says that manufacturers\' results were mixed.  Non-auto retail sales are up from a year ago, as well, according to most Districts, although the shift of Easter from March last year to April this year makes comparisons difficult.  Activity levels in service industries--including temporary help, health services, professional and technical services, and transportation and shipping--are also expanding according to District reports.  The pace of housing market activity is said to be moderating in many Districts, while commercial activity is firming.  A majority of Districts note that labor markets, at least for skilled workers, are tight or are tightening.  While energy costs are high and costs for selected other inputs are rising, businesses continue to have limited ability to raise their selling prices.   \n\n\nConsumer Spending and Tourism\n\nThe majority of Districts cite improving retail sales overall, but Richmond and Cleveland experienced sluggish or disappointing results.  Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco all report modest to solid gains, although year-over-year comparisons have been complicated by Easter\'s shift from March in 2005 to April in 2006.  Several Districts report strong sales in home and garden products and building goods.  Reports on apparel and grocers are mixed.  Retail inventories were generally at desired levels across the country.\n  \n\nAuto sales were mixed across the Districts.  Many Districts report that sales were short of year-ago levels, but Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, and Minneapolis all indicate that sales improved from the prior survey period.  While demand in San Francisco was stronger than expected, Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas all cite flat sales.  Many Districts continue to say that sales of imports and used cars are stronger than new domestic vehicles.  \n\n\nMost of the reports on travel and tourism are positive.  Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco all cite modest to strong improvements, and while New York saw tourism softening slightly, it was still at high levels.  In contrast, tourism was mixed in Richmond.  Ski resorts in the Boston District continued to suffer from lack of snowfall, but tourism was thriving in the Boston metro area.  A record-setting ski season was reported in Virginia, and Minneapolis saw a positive ski season in parts of the District. \n\n\nServices Industries\n\nAll Districts reporting on nonfinancial services note increased activity during the first quarter relative to a year ago.  Health-care services expanded in the Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts.  Professional and technical services activity increased according to Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, and Dallas, while San Francisco notes mixed conditions in information technology services.\n  \n  \nTemporary employment firms in the New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts report modest demand growth in the first and early second quarters. A large New York employment agency found increased demand for legal and financial services employees, while Dallas contacts noted increased demand for temporary workers in high-tech and light industrial manufacturing. \n\n\nTransportation services activity improved this quarter, according to reports from the Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts.  Trucking and shipping respondents from the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and St. Louis Districts report increased growth relative to a year ago.  While Cleveland\'s contacts continue to express concern about fuel costs, many now believe that they can increase their base rates, given the strength of demand.\n\n\nManufacturing\n\nReports on manufacturing activity remain positive.  Districts describe shipments and orders as continuing to strengthen--significantly in some cases and gradually or steadily in others.  Only Atlanta characterizes overall manufacturing activity as mixed, although New York indicates a retrenchment in orders and shipments in early April followed a strong March.  All Districts mentioning near-term forecasts say that, on balance, manufacturers expect business to remain on an upward trajectory.\n  \n\nMultiple Districts note strong or expanding production of steel, construction inputs, machine tools, aircraft equipment, and food.  Production capacity for mining equipment in the Chicago District is reportedly booked through 2007.  Chicago described heavy- and medium-duty truck orders as remaining solid, but light vehicle sales as flat, with some signs of excess auto inventories.  Other District updates on auto assembly and parts production were mixed--some up and others down. Trends in apparel-making also varied, with Richmond and Dallas citing increases but Atlanta, St. Louis, and San Francisco indicating shutdowns or disappointments.  \n\n Although several Districts describe labor demand in the manufacturing sector as mixed, most report some form of pickup.  For example, Richmond says that ""factory employment grew modestly,"" Cleveland notes more hiring on the part of durable goods producers, and Boston indicates that most manufacturers were hiring in order to obtain a ""higher skill mix."" District reports on capital spending tend to be either modestly positive or mixed. \n\n\nReal Estate and Construction\n\nMost Districts report cooling and moderation in their residential real estate markets. In general, year-on-year price appreciation seems to be lower than in quarters past, with San Francisco, Cleveland, Kansas City, Richmond, New York, and Boston all reporting more modest price growth in residential sales. Several Districts\' contacts noted that slower price increases were a healthy market outcome. Residential inventories are increasing; Kansas City, Minneapolis, Chicago, Atlanta, New York and Boston all saw increases in residential inventories compared with the first quarter of last year. The Dallas District, by contrast, registered particularly strong residential sales. \n  \n\nResidential construction is more regionally differentiated than overall residential sales and prices. In the West, Dallas and San Francisco both cite high levels of residential construction activity, with Dallas homebuilders reaching record sales for the first quarter of 2006. In the Midwest, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and St. Louis report declining residential construction. As well, the Chicago District mentions slower residential building in most areas. In the South, Atlanta indicates that single family construction remained strong but that some condominium projects have been postponed or cancelled.\n\n\nThe commercial real estate outlook appears to be predominantly positive across the reporting Districts--none report weakening commercial demand. San Francisco, Dallas, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Atlanta, and New York all register strong commercial activity. Kansas City, Chicago, and Richmond report steady to improving levels of activity. With vacancies declining in many locations, rents appear to be edging upwards.\n\n\nIn the West and the Midwest, commercial construction appears to be responding to increased commercial demand. Dallas, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Chicago, and St. Louis all report increasing or soon-to-be increasing commercial construction. San Francisco cites continued high levels of construction activity. In the South, Richmond reports little change in new construction, while overall development in Atlanta remained at low levels. The New York District featured relatively stable commercial construction.\n\n\nBanking and Finance\n\nReports of lending activity are mixed, as most Districts reporting on financial services continue to see decreases in demand for consumer loans and residential mortgages, coupled with moderate expansion of commercial and industrial lending.  St. Louis and Kansas City, in particular, saw a decrease in consumer lending, while both Chicago and Kansas City witnessed decreased demand for home equity loans.  Almost all Districts report declining demand for residential mortgages.  Meanwhile, commercial and industrial lending increased in nearly all Districts, with only St. Louis reporting a decline.  Bankers in Richmond noted that commercial lending for mergers and acquisitions and construction remained high.  Respondents in San Francisco mentioned an increase in venture capital financing.\n  \n\nWhile reports of credit quality are positive across the board, delinquency reports are more varied, with low delinquency rates in Atlanta, commercial and industrial delinquency rates increasing slightly in New York, home mortgage delinquency rates increasing somewhat in Dallas, and respondents in Philadelphia predicting a possible future increase in delinquencies due to rising interest rates on adjustable-rate mortgages.  Deposit growth was steady in Cleveland and Kansas City, sluggish in Chicago, and flat in Dallas.  Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco all report fierce competition for loans and narrow net interest margins.  However, credit standards remained virtually unchanged in all Districts except for New York, where standards tightened slightly for consumer loans.\n\n\nAgriculture and Natural Resources\n\nAdverse weather conditions and high energy costs are affecting agricultural prospects in much of the country. Although recent rains have brought some relief, dry weather has reportedly stressed pastureland and crops in the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. By contrast, unusually wet weather has delayed fieldwork in the San Francisco District.  Ranchers facing poor pasturage in Kansas City and Dallas are culling their herds and giving supplemental feed unusually early; as a result, Kansas City reports downward pressure on prices for feedlot cattle. In San Francisco, prices received by ranchers have softened but remain at a high level. St. Louis and Minneapolis report that one-half to two-thirds of the winter wheat crop is in good to excellent condition, but the Kansas City crop is described as poor, and Dallas reports that half the District wheat crop will be lost. Reflecting relative crop prices and the high cost of fertilizer, Chicago and St. Louis farmers are said to be shifting acreage from corn to soybeans. Contacts in Dallas and San Francisco also note the high cost of fertilizer and fuel, while Chicago and Dallas indicate that these costs are combining with dry conditions to cause cash flow problems for farmers. \n  \n In the energy sector, demand for oil and natural gas or oil services remains robust and energy activity continues to expand, according to contacts in the Dallas, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. Minneapolis reports that energy activity is stable at a high level. Dallas and Kansas City indicate that the count of active oil and gas rigs continues to rise. In the Gulf of Mexico, Dallas notes that the rig count is close to pre-Katrina levels, while Atlanta reports that the share of oil and gas still ""shut in"" amounted to just 23 percent for oil and 14 percent for natural gas in early April. Dallas, Kansas City, and San Francisco contacts see little or no excess capacity in the energy sector. In particular, Kansas City contacts say that shortages of equipment and workers are constraining drilling activity; pipeline capacity is also limited in some areas.  In the Minneapolis District, almost all open mines are producing near capacity. \n\nPrices and Wages\n\nHigh energy prices were at the forefront of most Districts\' mentions of cost pressures.  Manufacturers in most Districts cite rising costs for other inputs, with metals mentioned most frequently along with petroleum-related products.  While no District reports that cost increases have intensified in the latest survey period, Kansas City says that firms were having greater difficulty obtaining steel and aluminum.  Services firms are also reported to be facing higher costs, notably for utilities, shipping, and transportation. Many Districts describe firms as attempting to raise selling prices but having mixed success, with price increases generally either smaller than the cost increases or less widespread.  Richmond, Cleveland, and Chicago, for example, mention manufacturing firms\' limited ability to recoup higher costs; Boston and Dallas say competitive pressures are constraining some price increases, and Atlanta notes that the ability to pass on cost increases varies across firms, depending in part on the strength of demand and contract arrangements.  Construction materials costs have also risen, or supplies are tight, according to reports from Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas.\n  \n\nA number of Districts, including Cleveland, Richmond, and Dallas, cite high energy prices as an explanation for weaker than expected tourism results, auto sales, or retail sales, especially to lower-income consumers, with the impact occurring both directly by constraining consumers\' driving and indirectly by reducing the income available for purchases after paying for home fuel and transportation fuel.  Atlanta and Chicago note the possibility of such energy cost impacts as a risk to the summer outlook.\n\n District reports from Boston, New York, Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas say that labor markets are tightening, especially for skilled positions.  Philadelphia, Minneapolis, San Francisco, and Atlanta indicate that labor markets remain tight in at least some parts of their Districts.  Contacts in Atlanta, Richmond, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas state that truck drivers are in short supply.  Wages continue to move up, but only a few Districts--New York, Dallas, and Kansas City--mention a pickup in the pace of raises, while Philadelphia cites firms more often paying in the high end of salary ranges.  Richmond reports no pickup, but a continuation of ""brisk"" wage increases in services. Boston says manufacturing wage increases are in the same range as last year, Chicago cites a steady pace of labor cost increases, and Cleveland notes no reports of accumulating wage pressure, while Minneapolis and San Francisco mention moderate overall wage increases.

Several Districts characterized the overall pace of economic growth as ""moderate"" or ""modest,"" although San Francisco reported that its economic expansion remained ""solid"" and Atlanta and St. Louis described overall conditions as ""mixed.""  The Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco reports each highlighted a decline in the overall rate of economic growth in their Districts. Most reports on retail sales indicated slightly weaker conditions, on balance, than earlier in the year.  But tourist spending remained robust, albeit with evidence of slower growth in some areas, and activity expanded for providers of nonfinancial services to businesses and consumers.  Reports from the manufacturing sector were strong, with significant gains in output and sales, especially for durable goods.  Producers in the agricultural and natural-resource sectors also saw strong demand, although some weather-related difficulties and other supply constraints were noted.  Activity in residential real estate markets cooled in most parts of the country, but various Districts reported an ongoing pickup in demand for commercial space.  Among financial institutions, lending activity mirrored developments in the economy more generally:  commercial and industrial lending expanded further, while most Districts reported a decline in residential mortgage lending and some noted reduced demand for consumer loans. Increases in wages and in prices of final goods and services remained modest on net.  Upward pressure from the elevated prices of energy and other inputs persisted; while this pressure increased further in some cases, a few Districts noted a moderation in prices for some items.  Scattered reports from various Districts indicated an increase in manufacturers\' and retailers\' ability to pass such cost increases on to final prices.  More generally, however, Districts reported that vigorous competition held price increases down, and some contacts noted reliance on productivity increases to maintain profit margins in the face of rising input costs.  Labor markets tightened a bit further in most areas.  Increases in base wages and salaries generally remained moderate, but they were relatively rapid for workers with specialized skills in a wide range of sectors. Many reports indicated that consumer spending on retail goods weakened slightly during the survey period.  Although most Districts reported gains in retail sales compared with a year earlier, they generally characterized the pace of growth as modest or disappointing.  Retail sales were ""mixed"" or ""varied"" in Boston, New York, and Atlanta, ""flat"" in Richmond, ""cooling"" in Dallas, and ""below expectations"" in Chicago and San Francisco. Most Districts reported that sales gains for department stores and smaller retail establishments were limited or below retailers\' expectations.  Sales were healthy for luxury retailers but relatively weak among ""big box"" retailers and other low-price outlets.  Cleveland and Chicago reported that general retail spending was held down in part by high gas prices, which have squeezed households\' budgets and reduced the frequency of shopping trips. In general, sales of automobiles and light trucks were flat to down.  Sales remained healthier for imported vehicles than for domestic makes despite the revival of sales incentives for the latter, as high gas prices continued to nudge buyers towards fuel-efficient models.  Inventories reportedly were undesirably high for SUVs and light trucks in some areas. Activity in the travel and tourism sector generally remained at high levels or increased further, although a few reports indicated that the pace of growth has slowed.  New York noted that occupancy rates in Manhattan recently edged down from very high levels.  Performance was mixed in Richmond\'s tourism sector, and Kansas City and Minneapolis reported that summer tourism activity has been at or only slightly above year-earlier levels.  Atlanta reported ""cautious optimism"" in the tourist trade and increased tourist traffic to Florida destinations, while San Francisco reported that tourist activity increased further from very high levels in Hawaii and other destinations throughout the West. Activity in the nonfinancial services sectors generally expanded further, although the pace of growth reportedly slowed in the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts.  Providers of business and professional services, such as advertising, accounting, management consulting, and technology services, saw solid demand in general and increased activity in the Boston, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts.  Providers of permanent and temporary employee placement services were quite active, with modest or better increases in hiring reported in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Dallas Districts.  Reports on the health-care sector were mixed, with ""brisk"" activity reported by San Francisco but Richmond noting that activity was ""flat to lower."" Reports on the transportation sector suggested further increases in activity on net.  Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, and Dallas pointed to recent expansion in rail freight and trucking activity, and San Francisco reported strong demand for transportation services.  By contrast, Cleveland and Chicago noted slight declines in trucking tonnage and rail tonnage, respectively, with the latter attributed to reduced shipments of construction materials. Reports on manufacturing activity indicated significant gains across most Districts during June and July.  The only slightly weak reports came from New York, where manufacturers reported decelerating activity in July in the wake of a strong June, and St. Louis, where manufacturing conditions were mixed. Among products, demand was especially vigorous for various durable goods.  Substantial sales gains were reported for makers of electrical equipment and information technology products such as semiconductors, along with further increases in orders and activity for makers of commercial aircraft and products used for national defense.  The reports also pointed to a further rise in demand for makers of heavy equipment, machine tools, and steel, offset in part by reduced demand for smaller equipment that is oriented towards residential construction activity.  Demand for building materials was mixed but generally positive.  Atlanta reported a drop in demand for concrete, but Chicago reported strong demand for wallboard, and Richmond and Minneapolis noted further increases in the production of fabricated metals.  Among nondurable products, the reports indicated strong demand and further growth for chemicals, plastics, textiles, and processed food. The Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts noted that capacity utilization was high in various manufacturing sectors and increased a bit further in general.  Looking ahead, manufacturers in the Boston, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts reported plans to increase their capital spending over the balance of the year, but in the Kansas City District expectations for future capital spending remained low. With only scattered exceptions, Districts reported slower activity in residential real estate markets.  For new and existing homes, available reports indicated that the pace of sales declined and that the inventory of available homes and time on the market rose in most major metropolitan areas nationwide.  Slower sales activity has translated into more limited price gains, and residential construction activity has fallen in most Districts as well. The St. Louis and Dallas Districts were exceptions to the general slowdown in residential market activity.  In the St. Louis District, the pace of home sales was largely unchanged or up slightly compared with a year earlier, although residential construction slowed there.  Housing markets have remained resilient in the Dallas District, where despite signs of cooling, ""home demand remains strong"" and residential building activity has been ""robust."" As home demand has slipped more generally, scattered reports indicated a strengthening in demand for rental units.  New York reported that the market for apartment rentals has been tightening in Manhattan, and according to Atlanta slower condominium sales in Florida have prompted owners to convert some units to rental property. Slower activity on the residential side was offset in part by firmer activity on the commercial side.  Demand for commercial space was strong in general, and the market tightened further in most Districts.  Commercial construction activity was at high levels and increased further in the Dallas, Atlanta, and Richmond Districts.  By contrast, Chicago reported a modest slowdown in commercial construction activity, and Kansas City noted that ""commercial real estate activity was mostly flat."" Builders in some areas faced moderate constraints on construction activity.  High construction costs reportedly were a restraining factor that delayed or caused the cancellation of some building projects in the Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts.  Moreover, Atlanta reported that some commercial building projects along the Gulf Coast have been put on hold until late fall, after the current hurricane season is over. Overall lending activity remained strong on net but growth slowed in most Districts, as continued strength in business loans was offset by further weakening in loans to households.  On the business side, commercial and industrial lending generally was at high levels and rose further in many Districts.  The main exceptions were Richmond, where rising interest rates reportedly contributed to a decline in commercial lending, and Atlanta, where commercial lending ""remained slow overall."" Loans to households weakened somewhat in most Districts, as ongoing declines in mortgage lending were reinforced by slightly slower consumer lending in some areas.  Most Districts reported a reduction in the pace of mortgage lending, although St. Louis saw a slight increase.  While consumer lending was reported to be stable in a few Districts, it slowed somewhat in the St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts.  New York noted overall weakening in loan demand, with especially pronounced declines for consumer loans and mortgages for commercial real estate.  In most Districts, credit quality remained high across all loan categories. Reports indicated further expansion of demand for most agricultural and natural-resource products, but growing conditions for crops in some regions were hampered by dry weather.  Demand was strong for most crops and livestock products, and prices generally remained firm even for products in ample supply.  Dry conditions constrained growing in the Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and Atlanta Districts, holding yields on corn, cotton, and other crops below normal levels.  Dry conditions also caused pasture deterioration in the St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, increasing operating costs for livestock producers and prompting some to reduce or liquidate herds.  By contrast, dry weather contributed to healthy crop conditions for corn, cotton, and other items in the St. Louis District.  High input prices reportedly squeezed agricultural profit margins in some areas, with Chicago noting an increase in farmers\' reliance on operating loans and Kansas City reporting an expected drop in farm incomes this year. Activity was robust in the natural-resources sector.  Dallas, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Minneapolis reported further increases in extraction activities for oil and natural gas.  Demand for labor and equipment was strong, and some producers reported labor shortages and difficulties obtaining needed materials and equipment.  Producers of natural gas continued to operate at high levels, although Dallas and San Francisco reported that inventories have risen substantially, causing prices to decline. Increases in prices of final goods and services generally remained modest, despite the pressures from high prices for selected inputs and further increases for some.   Manufacturers\' and retailers\' ability to pass cost increases on to final prices varied.  Providers of transportation services have been able to apply fuel surcharges, significantly increasing the price of their services in some areas over the past year.  In addition, Atlanta noted rising prices charged by various service providers, and Kansas City reported an increase in the percentage of manufacturers reporting higher prices on finished goods.  Other reports indicated more limited pricing power and smaller increases in final prices.  Richmond reported that retail prices rose at a slower pace in recent weeks, and Kansas City reported that recent and planned increases in retail prices were unchanged from the previous survey period.  Dallas noted that weaker demand of late reduced firms\' ability to raise prices in some industries. District reports indicated that labor markets were tight in general and tightened a bit further in most areas.  Increases in base wages and salaries generally remained moderate overall, with scattered indications of faster growth for some workers.  San Francisco noted that numerical reports on wage increases generally were in the range of 3 to 4 percent.  In the Kansas City District, the fraction of firms reporting ""above-normal"" wage increases edged up, and Dallas reported significant pay increases for workers employed through temporary services firms. Wage increases remained relatively rapid for skilled workers in many areas, including managerial and professional employees and those with specialized occupational skills in a variety of industries.  Moreover, New York reported that the market for recent college graduates has tightened, with starting salaries up 7 percent over the past year in that city.', 'hiring market': 7, 'material prices': 6}",7.0,5.0,6.0,6.0

Banking contacts also cited increased demand for mortgages as the key driver of overall loan demand. Conversely, commercial real estate conditions continued to deteriorate in many Districts, with the exception being warehouse and industrial space where construction and leasing activity remained steady. Consumer spending growth remained positive, but some Districts reported a leveling off of retail sales and a slight uptick in tourism activity. Demand for autos remained steady, but low inventories have constrained sales to varying degrees. Reports on agriculture conditions were mixed, as some Districts are experiencing drought conditions. Districts characterized the outlooks of contacts as generally optimistic or positive, but with a considerable degree of uncertainty. Restaurateurs in many Districts expressed concern that cooler weather would slow sales, as they have relied on outdoor dining. Banking contacts in many Districts expressed concern that delinquency rates may rise in coming months, citing various reasons; however, delinquency rates have remained stable.\nEmployment and Wages\nEmployment increased in almost all Districts, though growth remained slow. Employment gains were reported most consistently for manufacturing firms, although firms continued to report new furloughs and layoffs. Most Districts continued reporting tight labor markets, attributing it to workers' health and childcare concerns, with many firms consequently offering increased schedule flexibility; a few Districts, however, noted some firms were finding it easier to hire workers. Wages increased slightly in most Districts, often tied to firms' difficulty finding workers, especially for low-wage or high-demand jobs. Some firms reported returning wages (and raises) to normal levels, but many reported more stable wages.\nPrices\nPrices rose modestly across Districts since the previous report. Input costs generally increased faster than consumer prices; however, some sectors—notably construction, manufacturing, retail, and wholesale—passed along the higher costs to consumers. Overall, consumer prices across Districts rose modestly, with the notable exceptions of food, automobiles, and appliances, which increased significantly. Retail gasoline prices declined. Input costs increased at varying degrees, mostly led by increases in materials costs, particularly steel and lumber.

Five Districts also noted that overall price increases had subsided to some degree from the prior period, while three others indicated no significant shift in price pressures. Firms in most Districts cited examples of steady or falling input prices, especially in the manufacturing and construction sectors, and more discounting by auto dealers. Districts also noted that increased consumer price sensitivity had forced retailers to narrow their profit margins and to push back in turn on their suppliers' efforts to raise prices.

Consumer spending, particularly on retail goods, inched down in recent weeks. Several reports cited heightened price sensitivity by consumers and noted that households continued to trade down and to shift spending away from discretionary goods. Activity in the leisure and hospitality sector varied by District and segment; while air travel was robust overall, demand for restaurants, hotels, and other establishments softened due to elevated prices, as well as to unusual weather conditions in certain regions. Manufacturing activity was largely unchanged, and supply bottlenecks normalized further. Nevertheless, delivery delays for electrical components continued. Ongoing shipping disruptions in the Red Sea and Panama Canal did not generally have a notable impact on businesses during the reporting period, although some contacts reported rising pressures on international shipping costs. Several reports highlighted a pickup in demand for residential real estate in recent weeks, largely owing to some moderation in mortgage rates, but noted that limited inventories hindered actual home sales. Commercial real estate activity was weak, particularly for office space, although there were reports of robust demand for new data centers, industrial and manufacturing spaces, and large infrastructure projects. Loan demand was stable to down, and credit quality was generally healthy despite a few reports of rising delinquencies. The outlook for future economic growth remained generally positive, with contacts noting expectations for stronger demand and less restrictive financial conditions over the next 6 to 12 months.\n\nLabor Markets\nEmployment rose at a slight to modest pace in most Districts. Overall, labor market tightness eased further, with nearly all Districts highlighting some improvement in labor availability and employee retention. Businesses generally found it easier to fill open positions and to find qualified applicants, although difficulties persisted attracting workers for highly skilled positions, including health-care professionals, engineers, and skilled trades specialists such as welders and mechanics. Wages grew further across Districts, although several reports indicated a slower pace of increase. Employee expectations of pay adjustments were reportedly more in line with historical averages.\n\nPrices\nPrice pressures persisted during the reporting period, but several Districts reported some degree of moderation in inflation. Contacts highlighted increases in freight costs and several insurance categories, including employer-sponsored health insurance. Nevertheless, businesses found it harder to pass through higher costs to their customers, who became increasingly sensitive to price changes.
